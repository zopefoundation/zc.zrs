ZRS Primary Storages
====================

A ZRS primary storage is a wrapper of a file storage that also
provides a network service to support replication.  Let's create a
primary storage.  We'll first create a File Storage:

    >>> import ZODB.FileStorage
    >>> fs = ZODB.FileStorage.FileStorage('Data.fs')

Then we'll create a primary storage using this.  A primary storage
takes the following arguments:

- The underlying storage

- The address to listen on, and

- An optional Twisted reactor to register with.  Normally, ZRS manages
  it's own reactor, but for demonstration/test purposes, we can pass
  in a special reactor that lets us demonstrate primary
  storages without actually creating network connections.

Let's create a primary storage:

    >>> import zc.zrs.primary
    >>> ps = zc.zrs.primary.Primary(fs, ('', 8000), reactor)
    INFO zc.zrs.primary:
    Opening Data.fs ('', 8000)

Now, we can use this just like any other storage:

    >>> from ZODB.DB import DB
    >>> import persistent.dict
    >>> db = DB(ps)
    >>> conn = db.open()
    >>> ob = conn.root()
    >>> ob.x = persistent.dict.PersistentDict()
    >>> commit()

We can connect to it to get data that have been committed.  We're
going to connect using the test reactor:

    >>> connection = reactor.connect(('', 8000))
    INFO zc.zrs.primary:
    IPv4Address(TCP, '127.0.0.1', 47245): Connected

(We see logging output.)

The connection represents the server.  It accepts two string messages.
The first message is the protocol, which must be "zrs2.0".
The second message is the starting transaction.  We'll send the
messages by calling the send method on the connection:

    >>> connection.send("zrs2.0")

The second message is the identifier of the last transaction seen by
the client.  We'll pass a transaction id of all zeros, indicating that
we have no data and want all of the data the storage has:

    >>> connection.send("\0"*8) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    INFO zc.zrs.primary:
    IPv4Address(TCP, '127.0.0.1', 47245):
       start '\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00' (1900-01-01 00:00:00.000000)

The client may send empty messages, and only empty messages, after the
initial messages:

    >>> connection.send("")
    DEBUG zc.zrs.primary:
    IPv4Address(TCP, '127.0.0.1', 47245): keep-alive

These empty messages are ignored.

The server will send back a numer of sized messages.  Most of these
messages will be a pickles.  The testing reactor set up a transpoer
with a read method that takes care of reading each message and
unpickling it for us.  This will let us look at the server output as
data.

The first message is the transaction header for the first transaction
in the database, which is the one that creates the root object.

let's look at the first message:

    >>> message_type, data = connection.read()
    >>> message_type
    'T'
    >>> tid, status, user, description, extension = data

The transaction id is a time stamp.  We can use the the ZODB TimeStamp
module to display it.  The other data is pretty boring in this
case. :)

    >>> from ZODB.TimeStamp import TimeStamp
    >>> def ts(v):
    ...     return str(TimeStamp(v))
    >>> ts(tid), status, user, description, extension
    ('2007-03-21 20:32:57.000000', ' ', '', 'initial database creation', {})

The next message is a store message for object 0:

    >>> message_type, data = connection.read()
    >>> message_type
    'S'

    >>> oid, serial, version, data_txn = data
    >>> from ZODB.utils import u64
    >>> int(u64(oid)), ts(serial), version, data_txn
    (0, '2007-03-21 20:32:57.000000', '', None)

The data are sent as a separate (non-pickle) message:

    >>> data = connection.read(raw=True)
    >>> len(data)
    60

Finally, there will be a commit record marking the end of the
transaction:

    >>> connection.read()
    ('C', ('\x1a\x14\x0e\x11^\xf2\xe3\x15\xdb\xcb[z\x03+\xf2"',))

The data for the commit contains a md5 checksup of the
identifier of the last transaction seen by the client sent during
client connection, and the records, not including the commit
record, sent to the client.

We can continue reading any additional transactions. In this case
there is only one:

    >>> tid, status, user, description, extension = connection.read()[1]
    >>> ts(tid), status, user, description, extension
    ('2007-03-21 20:32:58.000000', ' ', '', '', {})

    >>> for i in range(2):
    ...     oid, serial, version, data_txn = connection.read()[1]
    ...     data = connection.read(raw=True)
    ...     print (int(u64(oid)), ts(serial), version, len(data), data_txn)
    (0, '2007-03-21 20:32:58.000000', '', 78, None)
    (1, '2007-03-21 20:32:58.000000', '', 57, None)

    >>> connection.read()
    ('C', ('\x04\xc8\x8d\xd0e\xe2\xdba:\x10uTk\x85\x04\xa7',))

    >>> import time
    >>> time.sleep(0.1)
    >>> connection.have_data()
    False

If we commit more data, however, the additional data will be made
available:

    >>> ob = ob.x
    >>> ob.x = persistent.dict.PersistentDict()
    >>> commit()

    >>> tid, status, user, description, extension = connection.read()[1]
    >>> ts(tid), status, user, description, extension
    ('2007-03-21 20:32:59.000000', ' ', '', '', {})

    >>> for i in range(2):
    ...     oid, serial, version, data_txn = connection.read()[1]
    ...     data = connection.read(raw=True)
    ...     print (int(u64(oid)), ts(serial), version, len(data), data_txn)
    (1, '2007-03-21 20:32:59.000000', '', 78, None)
    (2, '2007-03-21 20:32:59.000000', '', 57, None)

    >>> connection.read()
    ('C', ('\xe4\xd4\xbc\xb5Im\xb6\x01\x80\xf0r"\x97\xeb[\x8a',))

In all of the examples we've seen, the data_txn is None.  Let's undo
the last transaction:

    >>> db.undo(ps.undoLog()[0]['id'])
    >>> commit()

Now, the undo transaction will be available:

    >>> tid, status, user, description, extension = connection.read()[1]
    >>> ts(tid), status, user, description, extension
    ('2007-03-21 20:33:00.000000', ' ', '', '', {})

    >>> for i in range(2):
    ...     oid, serial, version, data_txn = connection.read()[1]
    ...     data = connection.read(raw=True)
    ...     print (int(u64(oid)), ts(serial), version, len(data),
    ...            data_txn and ts(data_txn))
    (1, '2007-03-21 20:33:00.000000', '', 57, '2007-03-21 20:32:58.000000')
    (2, '2007-03-21 20:33:00.000000', '', 0, None)

    >>> connection.read()
    ('C', ('2\xb1\x136\xff\xaa\xd0\x9f\x01H\xe9\xe2?\xca\xf6\xcd',))

Let's save the transaction id and then commit some new data:

    >>> saved_tid = tid
    >>> ob = conn.root()
    >>> ob.y = persistent.dict.PersistentDict()
    >>> commit()

Of course, we'll see this new data:

    >>> tid, status, user, description, extension = connection.read()[1]
    >>> ts(tid), status, user, description, extension
    ('2007-03-21 20:33:01.000000', ' ', '', '', {})

    >>> for i in range(2):
    ...     oid, serial, version, data_txn = connection.read()[1]
    ...     data = connection.read(raw=True)
    ...     print (int(u64(oid)), ts(serial), version, len(data), data_txn)
    (0, '2007-03-21 20:33:01.000000', '', 98, None)
    (3, '2007-03-21 20:33:01.000000', '', 57, None)

    >>> connection.read()
    ('C', ('\xbd\x16\x10\xab\x8c\x9b\xedB\xe9do%]\xb7\xe7v',))

Let's create another connection.  This time though, we'll send our
saved transaction as the starting transaction:

    >>> connection2 = reactor.connect(('', 8000))
    INFO zc.zrs.primary:
    IPv4Address(TCP, '127.0.0.1', 47246): Connected

    >>> connection2.send("zrs2.0")
    >>> connection2.send(saved_tid) # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    INFO zc.zrs.primary:
    IPv4Address(TCP, '127.0.0.1', 47246):
        start '\x03lk\x91\x00\x00\x00\x00' (2007-03-21 20:33:00.000000)

When we get data from this connection, we'll only get the data written
after the saved transaction:

    >>> tid, status, user, description, extension = connection2.read()[1]
    >>> ts(tid), status, user, description, extension
    ('2007-03-21 20:33:01.000000', ' ', '', '', {})

    >>> for i in range(2):
    ...     oid, serial, version, data_txn = connection2.read()[1]
    ...     data = connection2.read(raw=True)
    ...     print (int(u64(oid)), ts(serial), version, len(data), data_txn)
    (0, '2007-03-21 20:33:01.000000', '', 98, None)
    (3, '2007-03-21 20:33:01.000000', '', 57, None)

    >>> connection2.read()
    ('C', ('_\x95\x8a\xcb\r\xb9/\x1cz\x88\x1d\x1bm\xd0h\x86',))

The servers will spew data for ever, or until their connections are
closed:

    >>> connection.close() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    INFO zc.zrs.primary:
    IPv4Address(TCP, '127.0.0.1', 47245):
       Disconnected <twisted.python.failure.Failure
       <class 'twisted.internet.error.ConnectionDone'>>

Or until the storage is closed:

    >>> ps.close() # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +ELLIPSIS
    INFO zc.zrs.primary:
    Closing Data.fs ('', 8000)
    ...
